## Features
### Note: Some features are not released yet (until March 22).

All features can be configured using the settings GUI: `/attributemod` or `/am`.
### Tooltip Attribute Price Overlay
Shows attribute values and an estimated total value when hovering over an item with attributes. Prices are refreshed every minute.

### Chest Value Overlay
This overlay summarizes all items with attributes in a chest, including their price. Items get highlighted if you hover over the list, and if you click an item, your mouse will be automatically moved to that item.
- Hold `Shift` to move the item directly to your inventory.
- Copy your items to clipboard using the `[Copy]` button.
- Choose between 5 different (compact or wide) overlay styles and choose the amount of displayed items with `/attributemod`.
- **NEW:** The overlay now supports scrolling!

### Command `/attributeprice` or `/ap`
Shows the cheapest items with an attribute. Works for armor, equipment, fishing items and weapons. You can hover over an item or **click to directly buy**.
Basically, it works exactly the same as my discord bot.

**Usage:** `/ap <attribute1> [level]` or `/ap <attribute1> [level] <attribute2> [level]`
Entering a level is optional. Use Minecraft's auto-completion for faster use.

### Command `/attributeupgrade` or `/au`
Shows the cheapest way of upgrading an attribute on an item to a specific level. The command will show you all items needed to buy, and the total price. Usually, upgrading like this is way cheaper than directly buying a Level 10 piece.

**Usage:** `/au <attribute> <item> <startlevel> <endlevel>`
Use Minecraft's auto-completion for attributes and items for faster use.

Shows Kuudra stats of any player. Has a `Normal` and `Compact` style.
Displays stats of teammates in Kuudra Party Finder.

- `/upgradecost` command to easily upgrade items in the crimson essence shop
- a "buy next" button for `/au` when in the auction house
## Security Note
This is the **only** way to download the Attribute Mod. It's hosted nowhere else than [here](https://github.com/anderle02/attributemod/releases/latest). Anyone trying to send you this mod **is trying to steal your account**, especially if it's "free".
