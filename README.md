# Attribute Mod
**A Forge 1.8.9 mod finding the price of attributes on Hypixel Skyblock.**
This is a lightweight mod, aiming to have the least impact on your FPS as possible. Nearly no calculations are done on your computer.

## Features
### Attribute Price Overlay
Shows attribute values and an estimated total value when hovering over an item with attributes. Prices are refreshed every minute.

### Command `/attributeprice` or `/ap`
Shows the cheapest items with an attribute. Works for armor, equipment, fishing items and weapons. You can hover over an item or **click to directly buy**.
Basically, it works exactly the same as my discord bot.

**Usage:** `/ap <attribute1> [level]` or `/ap <attribute1> [level] <attribute2> [level]`
Entering a level is optional. Use Minecraft's auto completion for faster use.

### Command `/attributeupgrade` or `/au`
Shows the cheapest way of upgrading an attribute on an item to a specific level. The command will show you all items needed to buy, and the total price. Usually, upgrading like this is way cheaper than directly buying a Level 10 piece.

**Usage:** `/au <attribute> <item> <startlevel> <endlevel>`
Use Minecraft's auto completion for attributes and items for faster use.

### Chest Overlay
This overlay summarizes all items with attributes in a chest, including their price. Items get highlighted if you hover over the list, and if you click an item, your mouse will be automatically moved to that item. Hold `Shift` to move the item directly to your inventory.
