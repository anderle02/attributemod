# Attribute Mod
**A Forge 1.8.9 mod finding the price of attributes on Hypixel Skyblock.**
This is a lightweight mod, aiming to have the least impact on your FPS as possible. Nearly no calculations are done on your computer.
## Disclaimer
This mod is **not public** and won't work without a **key**. Please visit [Kuudra Gang](https://discord.gg/kuudra) and run `/mod` for instructions on how to buy the mod.
*I am still learning modding and I just don't have the capacity for too many users, I hope you will understand.*
## Features
All features can be configured using the settings GUI: `/attributemod` or `/am`.
### Kuudra Profit Overlay
This overlay appears when you open a Kuudra reward chest.
- lists items in the chest including their value
- shows Kismet Feather and Kuudra Key prices
- **tells you if it's worth to reroll / claim a chest**

### Profit Per Hour Display
Shows profit per hour and a few more interesting statistics when playing Kuudra.
Manage the profit tracker with `/profittracker <start|stop|reset>`.

OR: Let the tracker only count the time when you are in Kuudra.

### [OLD] Command `/attributeprice` or `/ap`
Shows the cheapest items with an attribute. Works for armor, equipment, fishing items and weapons. You can hover over an item or **click to directly buy**.
Basically, it works exactly the same as my discord bot.

**Usage:** `/ap <attribute1> [level]` or `/ap <attribute1> [level] <attribute2> [level]`
Entering a level is optional. Use Minecraft's auto-completion for faster use.

### [OLD] Command `/attributeupgrade` or `/au`
Shows the cheapest way of upgrading an attribute on an item to a specific level. The command will show you all items needed to buy, and the total price. Usually, upgrading like this is way cheaper than directly buying a Level 10 piece.

**Usage:** `/au <attribute> <item> <startlevel> <endlevel>`
Use Minecraft's auto-completion for attributes and items for faster use.

**New:** Hotkey guiding you through all items to buy and openening the auction!

Displays stats of teammates in Kuudra Party Finder.

## Security Note
This is the **only** way to download the Attribute Mod. It's hosted nowhere else than [here](https://github.com/anderle02/attributemod/releases/latest). Anyone trying to send you this mod **is trying to steal your account**, especially if it's "free".
